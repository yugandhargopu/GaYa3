I don't know her name) walking around laughing out.\n Trust me,\n  that laugh made my day everyday and I was on cloud 9 each time I saw it.\n U were from another section and hence didn't get the chance to see u often. \n I think u merely recognised me then. /n I used to stare at you through glass from the main door( I was seated in the last bench and I could see u easily)..\n I remember all those times when u came to fill ur water bottle and it was twice tht I came and stood by u while filling water. \n U might think tht all this is of no use but trust me tht was the only thing tht mattered to me all throughout. \n I know tht I didn't dare to talk to u becoz I was shy or kinda an introvert.. I don't know../n anyway just remember tht u r a very special person to me.. "
